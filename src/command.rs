///
/// The type parameter `T` specifies the command's payload type.

///
/// A `Command` consists of a [`Selector`], that indicates what the command is
/// and what type of payload it carries, as well as the actual payload.
///
/// If the payload can't or shouldn't be cloned,
/// wrapping it with [`SingleUse`] allows you to `take` the payload.
/// The [`SingleUse`] docs give an example on how to do this.
///
/// ## Sources
///
/// Commands can come from multiple sources:
/// - Widgets can send custom commands via methods such as
/// [`EventCtx::submit_command`](crate::EventCtx::submit_command).
/// - If you are doing work in a background thread, your main way of sending
/// data back to the main thread is to use
/// [`ExtEventSink::submit_command`](crate::ext_event::ExtEventSink::submit_command).
/// - In a future version, when MenuItems are implemented, they will work by sending commands when selected.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```
/// use masonry::{Command, Selector, Target};
///
/// let selector = Selector::new("process_rows");
/// let rows = vec![1, 3, 10, 12];
/// let command = selector.with(rows);
///
/// assert_eq!(command.get(selector), &vec![1, 3, 10, 12]);
/// ```
